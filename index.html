            <h2>If - by Rudy Kipling - A Choice of Kipling's Verse (1943)</h2>
            <p>
              To say that this poem is my favorite could possibly by an oversight because I have found it just now after a parooze on all that google had to offer. I prefer it in audio form so that’s how I have included it.
              <br><br>
              This poem was written in the 1940s, when the world, for the most part, had just one thing on their mind: the Nazi party and their campaign. With war hanging over everyone’s heads, the population, especially young men, were surrounded by ideas of toughening themselves up to fight for the country. This country was trying to breed new fighters and young men are the perfect target. 
              <br><br>
              If by Rudy Kipling is, in its most bare form, a list of all the things you must do to be a man. In the context of 1940s America, its a list about how to be tough, yet fair.
              <br><br>
              Even if you are not a young american man preparing to go to war, this is a good poem for you to hear. No matter who you are, you need some hardening, or some softening, and you probably already know which. 
              <br><br>
              There is so much wisdom in this poem. “If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,/But make allowance for their doubting too;” This is one of the most important things about growing up - learning your voice. A well adjusted person sits directly between self doubt and self absorption. There is a similar pattern of language and content in the line “If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,  /Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,” This, to me, speaks to the universal human condition. We are walking amongst equals. Just like the previous anecdote, this line has an idea of balance. It is, in a sense, do not lose your humanity around authority, and do not lose your humanity when you possess authority.
              <br><br>
              The deeper gist of the poem is to round yourself as a person. Keep yourself in check, but also make sure your checks have their equal and opposite ballences.
              </p>

              <h2 class="section-title">College Essay</h2>
              <p>How many hours did I spend watching TV last year? What’s the average number of snacks I eat in a day?
                How strongly are these two activities correlated?<br><br>

                Just over a year ago I became fascinated with questions like these. I wanted a system to answer
                quantitative queries about behavior, so I wrote Lumberjack, an app for collecting and analyzing logs.
                Lumberjack began as a mere web page, but soon evolved into a multiplatform tool for meticulously logging
                actions of any sort, building a behavioral timeline, and analyzing that data.
                <br><br>
                Lumberjack is the most complex piece of software I have ever designed. It has Android, iOS, and web
                support, and the users data is synced between all three. Lumberjack’s servers sprawl across multiple
                Google cloud machines. There are over 55 thousand lines of code in the Lumberjack repository, and it
                requires over 1000 dependencies to run. I have been writing software since middle school, but never have
                I completed something of this magnitude.
                <br><br>
                While the development process itself, proved to be valuable enough for me to consider the project a
                worthwhile time investment; the real fun came from the data. In six months, I had accumulated over 1700
                entries, meticulously detailing my day-to-day behavior. I spend my money in splurges. Most days I spend
                nothing, but when I am in the mood to buy, I do not stop at one purchase. That was something that’s not
                so easy to determine without the help of analytics, and was the first indicator that this project has
                been a success.
                <br><br>
                My analysis became increasingly complex over time. I started to develop a system for intuiting
                properties of the day. The ratio of productive minutes (homework, programming, work, cleaning my room,
                etc.) to indulgence minutes (internet, tv, video games, etc.) provides a score of how well I budgeted my
                time that day. I also drew regressions between every combination of every category, looking for
                correlations. Using R and Javascript, I cranked out a ten dimensional scatter plot displaying the
                relationships between all my different behaviors. It’s satisfying to see my life visualized so
                succinctly before my eyes.
                <br><br>
                I became consumed by my project. Over time I was recording more entries and doing so more meticulously.
                After six months of dedicated logging, I determined that recording my every move was not a sustainable
                lifestyle. Instead, I revisit my data and run analyzations of different sorts. It turns out that The
                Office is my favorite show, which is not surprising, what was interesting is that with regard to total
                minutes watched, it appears that I like The Office precisely twice as much as I like the show Breaking
                Bad. I also found that days that I watch cartoons are days that have minimal productivity compared to
                days I watch dramas. I watch, on average, 32 minutes of TV a day.
                <br><br>
                When considering development of this beast, my most surprising takeaway was the sheer number of
                technologies that went into this one product. There are over 55 thousand lines of code in the Lumberjack
                repository, and it requires over 1000 dependencies to run. Forget my 55k, millions of lines of code have
                been written, optimized, rewritten, and minified so that Lumberjack has the power to analyze anyone's
                behavior. I had not realized the complexity a polished piece of software demands.
                <br><br>
                Lumberjack is my baby; I have poured my time and energy into its creation, and my intimate details into
                its database. I have learned that I am happiest when I am enthralled in a fascinating project. I was
                surprised at the patience I had when things got a bit tedious. Lumberjack has given me so many hilarious
                moments as my good friends and I recount just how our time is spent. Through a constant process of trial
                and tweaking, I have birthed this piece of software and I have never been more proud.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Memoir</h2>
            <p>Runescape was my everything. I became deeply enthralled in this online virtual world. After school, my best friends rushed off to hockey, baseball, and soccer while I hurried to spar with dragons. Of course the only physical activity that required was moving my pointer finger half a millimeter up and down, but I felt the rush as if I were wielding the sword itself. The desktop computer I used was hardly a desktop. The monitor was wedged between books on a shelf, eye-level to a third-grader. I would stand, nose nearly adjacent to this monitor for hours while the computer chassis whirred away at my feet. There was a chair directly behind me, but if I tried to sit, I would end up eye to eye with the screen again after any moment that I deemed required enhanced precision, which was frequently. The fascination of the screen would pull my face closer and elongate my neck gradually.<br><br>
              This video game had completely consumed my life. I remember a conversation between my two parents and my sister where they promised that if she gets a full scholarship to college they would use that money to take us on a trip around the world. I told them I didn’t want a trip and they should use my scholarship money to get me a really powerful runescape account. Something about progressing this character in a fantastical world was satisfying; apparently more satisfying than progressing my own life because I did not do much else. My parents realized that this behavior was not good for my development, and tried to deter me by implementing computer time limits and the works. That never stopped me. I was a clever kid and I knew damn well I could just go play on the computers in the library.<br><br>
              When I wasn’t playing the game, it was still on my mind. In class I would be writing objectives for when I got home. I bored my parents with irrelevant details about my online antics. Looking back on it, I will keep my kid from that game at all costs. So much of my developmental period was spent clicking away at monsters and chatting with adult men who had no life. I deeply regret not playing sports with the other kids.<br><br>
              As the years tick by, Runescape floats to that back of my mind as I become increasingly fascinated by writing software. I love that computers do exactly what I them to to, and the only limiting factor is my own cleverness. Instead of rushing home to play runescape I was rushing home to finish my program. I’m positive that I wrote more code in elementary school than all other elementary students in the state combined. By the time I was 12, I was not just passable, I was good.<br><br>
              The thing about having a cool, obscure hobby, is you have nobody to share it with. My friends don’t understand or care about writing software. I did not understand or care about the sports. A large part of who I was was being lived out in privacy.<br><br>
              Programming wasn’t my only hobby though. I have, at various times, been interested in skateboarding, gymnastics, video games, magic, and a plethora of others. These activities vary in nature, but they all have one similarity: they are all solo ventures. All of the sports I enjoyed always lacked a team. There was no collaboration.<br><br>
              The summer before my freshman year, I reach out to a startup in the area that was advertising a full time developer position, and I pitch my spiel: I can’t say I have experience in the field, I can’t say that I can’t make a long term commitment to the company, but my code speaks for itself, and you don’t need to pay me very much. Well they liked that a lot, and I spent my summer sitting on the train going to and from brookline every day. It was here that I was introduced to the industry, and ever since that first email in 8th grade, I’ve never had to try that hard to get hired.<br><br>
              I eventually quit that job and took up a higher paying position at a consulting company. A year later I left that job to work for the Plasma Fusion Science Center at MIT. Three days ago I accepted a job at startup called Vise AI, and I am trying to decide how much time I can allocate. As an elementary schooler learning the ropes of programming, I never would have imagined I would be doing the work I’m doing. I couldn’t have hoped for it! But behind the excitement of getting the longshot job, something is missing. Nobody is here to celebrate.</p>

            <p>The entries that I chose for my writer’s notebook were hand selected to be ones that would hopefully be the most interesting to read for others. Many of my writer's notebook entries sort of ‘fizzle out’ and never really pan out into anything worth reading. Below are 10 writers notebook entries that might be worth reading. 
              <br><br>
                I enjoyed the writer’s notebooking process in class because it was almost a ritual that we put thoughts in a written form. I did find that often I would get cut short, or finish super early and be bored. If I could change anything about the process it would be that we could have a task that we will move onto once the writing has been completed. That way you sort of transition yourself once you have taken an appropriate amount of time writing. Just a thought.
                <br><br>
                One challenging thing is that sometimes, I just don’t want to write. Writing expends a lot of energy - it probably burns calories - and by the end of the day I am tired. I always do write in it though, so that will probably make me not just a better writer, but a writer with more stamina. I will need to be able to write even when I don’t want to.
                <br><br>
                The most successful prompts, in my eyes, are ones that let you talk about yourself. Everyone likes talking about themselves so that is an easy way to get people writing quickly and enthusiastically.
                <br><br>
                I probably will hold onto my writer's notebook - I am a hoarder. But will I ever open it? Probably not. I imagine my grandkids dusting it off in 60 years, reading the entries, and thinking ‘What and idiot’

                <p>As our lives become more and more device and technology oriented, humans have to work less and less hard. But that is just the most obvious side effect. <br><br>
                  In the early ages of the internet, hackers would burrow through poorly configured networks of corporations and wreak havoc. Once a malicious actor has accessed that network, there were a number of potentially lucrative things that he could do with this access. In the 90s, the most popular way to syphon off company money happened strictly over the phone.<br><br>
                  The hackers would wait until 9PM friday night, even better if its a long weekend, take control of the incredibly popular internet connected office phone system that lived on many workers desks. They would then place hundreds or even thousands of overseas calls, letting the phones sit in ‘conversation’ for as long as they could before the IT staff could catch on. Often they could get away with this until the company got their next phone bill.<br><br>
                  When the bill comes in, they see that it’s thousands of dollars in excess to usual, and they immediately cut off their phone systems. The hackers, who have been controlling those overseas pay-per-minute lines, can accept all the profits from those calls. Company money just vanished into thin air and appeared into the hackers accounts.<br><br>

                <p>There was a knock at the door. I had carefully arranged for there to never be a knock. Nobody had business at this apartment but me. I slide all of the scales and cocaine behind the main couch and creep over to the door. I peer through the peephole, and just like I suspect, three suits. They had no identifying characteristics but these were the feds. Or the DEA. I ran back to my room and punched in the ridiculously long code that I use to secure the vault. Then, faster than I’ve ever moved before, I gathered up all the drugs that lay strewn across my living room. <br><br>
                  More knocks. I forced myself to catch my breath before opening the door, giving him my best I-just-woke-up face. They snatch me, handcuff me, and start to drag me out the door.<br><br>

                <p>Rodney Peterson didn’t know it, but his life was about to change. It was around 11 o’clock in the morning and he was sitting in his school cafeteria with Arnold, Randy, and Phil, eating his egg and baloney sandwich. He took a big bite and looked up only to have found himself locking eyes with none other than Carly Jones. Immediately, Ronnie broke the contact. But he could not restrain himself from glancing to see if she really was looking. She was.<br><br>
                  “Guys,” he glances again, “Carly Jones is on her way over- No! Don’t look now.” Rodney’s two counterparts turn their whole torsos to gape in disbelief. <br><br>
                  Rodney feels a wave of concern sweep across his body, as it is instinctual to begin to sweat a t crucial moments such as these. He could feel his heart beating up in his neck.<br><br>

                <p> Carl was both muscular and stupid, making him the perfect right hand man to Derek’s illicit operation. Powerful enough that Derek never gets his hands dirty, and stupid enough that there was no threat of a double crossing. This made Carl not much of a companion, but Derek found that he liked his company. No one else had ever seen the inside of Derek's apartment and when Carl would show up to drop off money at the end of each day, Derek would often invite him to stay for a blunt afterwards. This became something of a ritual. Two men who must keep either their identities or professions private from all prying eyes, really only have each other at the end of the day. <br><br>
                  Derek never did any of his drugs, not even to test them; he had people for that. He made it clear that Carl was expected to do the same. Often, Carl would not even be aware of what he was delivering. Derek says this is for plausible deniability reasons, but the truth is that if Carl knew the value he was transporting, he might not end up delivering it.

                  ‘Ah but I can’<br><br>
                  Immediately, upon realizing my most intimate details had been leaked, I could not help but to allow the flood of thoughts containing all of the worst things I’ve ever done and said. The darkest depths of my mind wiped the smile right of Moanolos face. Never have I felt that my privacy was this violated. I frantically thought of penguins trying to block my secrets from surfacing.

                <p>Black hair is swept back over his head. What is clean at the roots is a mess by the ends. This is the haircut of a man who can’t be bothered with haircuts. You will not read any emotion in his deep-set brown eyes. His whole face, for that matter, is an enigma. Those that do not know Derek well can’t tell what he’s thinking. Those that do don’t want to know. He has made a point to keep his tattoos off the visible areas - he did not need any large visible fingerprints. Also, it was nobody's business what was meaningful to Derek. A lot of Derek’s behavior was nobody's business.<br><br>
                  Derek’s presence was incredibly uniform; he always wore the same outfit and gave off the same energy. That outfit appeared incredibly standard: jeans and a black shirt. He knows the ridiculously high price tag of the clothes but no one else can tell. There was not a limit to any of Derek’s cash purchases. These exotic fabrics reminded him at all times who he was, and that he needs to act like it.

                <p>In front of me I have my noise cancelling headphones. In terms of technology, it is not very complex. In my pocket I have a computer that’s orders of magnitude more complex than them. What people don’t realize is how much innovation goes into a piece of tech, even a simple one like a pair of headphones.<br><br>
                  Let’s forget the electronic components for a moment. The plastic casing alone is a technological feat that would have been unfathomable 100 years ago. The plastic that was poured into a mould probably changed hands at least 3 times before arriving at the factory. The chemical properties of that particular plastic have been studied thoroughly, the result of multiple scientists’ life’s work. What I have right here contains 1000 years of innovation, repeatedly compounded to create an incredible product.<br><br>
                  To create a single pair of these headphones, airplanes, boats, trucks, plastic, moulds, screws, felt, engineers, physicists, and developers all have to work in an incredibly coordinated way to design and produce this product. People do not realize the hundred thousand man hours that are poured into the gas station earbuds that we throw out after the road trip.

                <p>The Black Klansmen was great because I felt fully immersed in the racially charged environment. People really hated black people at that time, and it’s evident in the movie. The characters also developed in a way that made me care about them. I hated that black lady that builds a relationship with the black klansmen. She was super mean about his job as a cop, even though he had nothing but good intentions. There is nothing more aggravating than extending a favor to someone only to have them throw it back in your face. He was literally fighting for the same thing she was.<br><br>
                  That time period had a lot of hate in the air; the KKK members were filled with rage. It raises an ethical dilemma though. The angry white couple legitimately believes that black people are the root of their problems. This couple thinks they are the heroes in this story. They think they were fighting for justice by assaulting black people. Should people really have free speech? Is there an objective wrong?

At this moment you are going to want some tricks up your sleeves for synthetic sparks. <br><br>
                  “What are you thinking about right now?” People love to hear this because it shows them direct attention, while also letting them talk about whatever they want. <br><br>

            <span class="section-sub-title d-block">The Grand Scheme</span>
            <p>Derek, a twenty something year old drug dealer, finds himself in a trepidatious situation when his trusted companion goes missing, along with a huge cache of drugs. He does not have any more cards in his hands, and he doesn’t know how to sit and wait for the game to shake out. What does a powerful man do when he feels helpless?</p>
            <span class="section-sub-title d-block">The Scene</span>
            <p>
              Derek paced through his living room, gripping his phone with heavily slicked hands. It had been over an hour since Carl’s expected return. With every passing minute, the ominous feeling seeps deeper into his stomach. He tried Carl again, patiently waiting until the answering machine, knowing deep down that he was not going to pick up. Carl, along with a full pound of MDMA had vanished into thin air. <br><br>
              Fifteen minutes late is traffic, thirty is a detor, forty five needs some explaining, but an hour? Derek knew that after an hour passed, the plan was not on track and he was, for the time being, down fifteen grand. Derek had not lost anything more than an ounce of weed in his years, and that could be chalked up to just the cost of doing business. He loved the big deals; he could make a thousand dollars in an hour. But at what cost? Where was Carl with his fifteen grand? <br><br>
              Derek sat, stood, paced, cursed, and cleaned in quick succession, unable to keep himself in one position for any significant amount of time. He kept running over what he knew: Carl left with the pack, planning to bring it to a long time customer. He never showed up at the house, and he never came back. Derek strained, brain racing, attempting to think his way out of these handcuffs. <br><br>
              A white hot energy dissipated from his chest, leaving his hands shaking and stomach sickened. Derek had been in the business for a decade now, and he couldn’t have made it that far without a strict protocol. He never met a buyer or a seller, ever. A customer would message Derek, knowing him only through various aliases. Derek would source that customer’s needs from his extensive network, then a worker is dispatched from his small pool of confidants. The transactions are completed all without any physical interactions from Derek. This type of predictability made life more relaxing for him, but Derek had no protocol for something like this.<br><br>
              Derek opened up his kitchen cabinet and got a full stack of his milky white ceramic plates. He found it funny how one plate does not weigh anything significant, but he could feel serious strain in his wrists as he transported the goods into his bedroom and set the stack down on his windowsill. His shitty Bronx apartment left him with a full view of the brick wall from the adjacent building. He slid open the window sticking his head out to scan below. The wind was fierce against his ears, and no one was lurking in the alley below. He grabbed the stack, cocked his shoulders, and heaved the plates out the window. They exploded against the bricks of the neighbors with a delicious shattering sound followed by the ping ping ping of ceramic rain drops hitting the asphalt below. <br><br>
              With a new cool and collected calm, he pulls out his phone and started cashing in some favors. <br><br>
              “Yes. Carl is gone. Full pound of molly. Aight soldier, carry on.” <br><br>
              “Hey man long time. I need you to keep an eye out for a lose pound of pink champagne in your area. Extra points if you find the chunky handler that comes with it. You know I always do, man.”<br><br>
              “Yes. The light pink. Just an hour and a half. I really hope it doesn’t come to that. Thanks brother.” <br><br>
              With that, He turned off his phone, struggled into his blacked out adidas’, and set out to get new plates.<br><br>

            <span class="section-sub-title d-block">Glass Castle Movie V.S. Book</span>
            <p>The most jarring difference between The Glass Castle novel and movie rendition is the heavy restructuring of the timeline that the point of view follows. Jeanette starts the book by briefly speaking from her adult perspective, before providing a thorough recount of her childhood. As the book progresses, Jeanette is growing up faster and faster, giving less description as she ages. It is not until the very end that she has grown into her adult self again. <br><br>
              The movie, on the other hand, does not stick to this format, and is constantly swapping between the young and old perspectives of Jeanette. This was a stylistic choice made by the director that drastically shifts the focus of the story. This is not, however, a butchered misunderstanding of Jeanette’s intent, in fact Walls herself was deeply involved in the production process. The movie is constructed in this manner to refocus the story on the theme of forgiveness.<br><br>
                The film was produced many years after the novel, and in that time Jeanette has changed. While the book was focused largely on the ideas of brutalistic parenting - that is the “sink or swim” mentality that Rex justifies as character building - the movie is all about the ending, when she forgives her parents for all they’ve done.<br><br>
                In the progression of the book, it is revealed immediately that Jeanette is a success, so when she flashes back to her unpleasant childhood, it’s clear that this is a story about her persevering. All through the book the reader waits for the happy ending they know is coming.<br><br>
                The movie, on the other hand, does not follow a chronological order of events. The viewer is constantly transported between a young and a modern Jeanette. This added adult perspective shows that even into adulthood, the Walls parents are very much present and problematic. Jeanette decides to shut her parents out entirely, and does so for many years before eventually exercising the forgiveness.<br><br>
                One large indicator that the movie has refocused is revealed when examining the endings. The ending of a piece will often indicate the intended takeaway. In the movie, the final scene is of forgiveness. She goes to her dying father after years of giving him the cold shoulder, effectively forgiving all that he has put her through. Even after the trauma, he’s still her father and that’s why she leaves her husband and runs to him. The book ends on an image of a candle “dancing along the border between turbulence and order.” This is a statement about the long lasting effects of the Walls’ parenting style. Jeanette’s whole life is balancing between turbulence and order.<br><br>
                The movie did not do a good job of converting the book into a visual format. The message is completely different and the events that take place have minimal overlap. The film was a success, it simply had a different intention. Jeannette Walls would have never let a director butcher her story, that’s how Rex taught her; this is what she wanted. She chose to take the movie down a different path and for that it is a different piece entirely.<br><br>

            <p>
                English is the only class for which it is mandated that every student take it every year K-12. By senior year in high school, there is no class that you must be taking except every student takes an english. That is because whoever it is that creates these mandates sees the value in making every kids writing and reading as solid as possible. There is no roof to how good you can get, and having powerful communication skills is the tool that everyone needs in their toolbox, no matter the profession. Better communicators will be more likeable, sociable, and profitable.
              <br><br>
                So to wrap up 12 years of English, this is how well I can communicate. Judge for yourself. I have written every word on the page, and I have also programmed the website myself. In a way, programming is just writing in an obscure language. I have been writing my whole academic career and I’m sure I will be writing in one form or another in my professional career as well. I cringe when I see badly written emails and miscommunications. I strive to appear affluent without arrogance. Concision without obfuscation. 
                <br><br>
                Preparing this portfolio was exhausting. I wanted to write the site myself, and I did not think about how much added work that was going to be. I am happy with the results aesthetically. Typing up the writer notebooks was a pain, but the editing process was almost fluid. I would just be reading and typing out slightly better versions than what was on the page.
                <br><br>
                I have enjoyed the English curriculum throughout the years, and I’m curious to see what my kids’ will look like.
